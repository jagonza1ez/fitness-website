# VSCode and GitHub Setup

This section will guide you through setting up Visual Studio Code (VSCode) to connect to GitHub so you can clone the repository, work on it locally, and push your changes back to GitHub.

## Step 1: Setting Up GitHub SSH Keys (Optional but Recommended)

SSH keys allow you to connect to GitHub securely without needing to enter your username and password each time. Here’s how to set them up:

1. **Check for Existing SSH Keys**  
   Open your terminal and check if you already have an SSH key:
   ```bash
   ls -al ~/.ssh
   ```
   If you see files like `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`, you may already have SSH keys set up.

2. **Generate a New SSH Key (if needed)**  
   If no key exists, generate a new SSH key by running:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
   - Replace `"your_email@example.com"` with the email you use for GitHub.
   - Press Enter to accept the default file location, then enter a passphrase (recommended).

3. **Add SSH Key to SSH Agent**  
   Start the SSH agent and add your new key:
   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

4. **Add SSH Key to GitHub**  
   - Copy your SSH key to the clipboard:
     ```bash
     cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
     ```
   - Go to your [GitHub SSH settings](https://github.com/settings/keys) and click **New SSH key**.
   - Paste your SSH key, give it a title (e.g., “My Laptop”), and save.

## Step 2: Clone the Repository Using VSCode

1. **Open VSCode**.
2. **Open the Command Palette** by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac).
3. Search for **Git: Clone** and select it.
4. **Enter the repository URL**:
   - For SSH:
     ```plaintext
     git@github.com:username/repository-name.git
     ```
   - For HTTPS (if not using SSH):
     ```plaintext
     https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
     ```
5. **Select a local folder** where you want to save the repository, and VSCode will clone it for you.
6. **Open the cloned folder** in VSCode.

## Step 3: Set Up Git in VSCode

1. **Configure Git**  
   If you haven’t configured Git on your computer, run these commands in the VSCode terminal to set your username and email:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your GitHub Username"
   git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Authentication in VSCode**  
   If you’re using HTTPS, VSCode may prompt you to sign in to GitHub the first time you push changes. Follow the prompts to complete GitHub authentication.

## Step 4: Create and Work on Your Branch

1. **Create a New Branch**  
   In VSCode’s terminal, create a branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch-name
   ```
   Replace `feature-branch-name` with a meaningful name for your feature or bug fix.

2. **Make Your Changes**  
   Edit files in the `client` or `server` directories as needed.

3. **Stage and Commit Changes**  
   - **Stage changes** by clicking the **Source Control** icon (left sidebar) and selecting the files you want to stage, or use:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
   - **Commit your changes** with a message describing what you did:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Add feature or fix bug"
     ```

## Step 5: Push Changes to GitHub

1. **Push Your Branch**  
   Push your changes to GitHub on your new branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-branch-name
   ```
2. **Create a Pull Request**  
   - Go to the repository on GitHub, where you’ll see an option to **Compare & pull request**.
   - Click it, add a title and description, and submit the pull request.

3. **Get Feedback and Merge**  
   After submitting the pull request, team members can review your changes, suggest improvements, and approve the merge when ready.
