# Set Up

Once you have VSCODE and connected to GITHUB, this file will hopefully assist you in setting up your environment and familirize yourself with MERN and the initial code.

We'll use VSCODE for coding and use GITHUB for our source control. 

The **main** branch will be protected. To add a feature, the team will create a new branch to work on that feature locally and will push their local branch to their remote branch on GITHUB. Once the feature is tested, and working with the rest of the code, we will merge it to main. 

Please document your code and create a .md file that describes your feature and how it works.

## Installation

- Make sure you have installed VSCODE and have it configured to your GitHub. Clone the Project

## Install Project Dependencies

1. Install Node.js - https://nodejs.org/en
2. Back End Dependencies 
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Setup Environment Variables **.env** file in the **src** folder:

   ```bash
   cd server/src
   ```

   create the .env file and paste the following:

   ```bash
   ATLAS_URI=
   JWT_SECRET=
   PORT=5050
   ```
   POC for the URI and JWT_SECRET link is Jesus Gonzalez.

   In the Server/src directory run the following:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

3. Front End Dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

# Run The project 
In the backend:

```
cd server/src
```

In essence, on the backend **server** directory, you can check for a ping to MondoDB.

```
node server.js
```

Ultimately, you want to see a message that it is listening to a port.

After we established & verified connection with MongoDB, we will connect to the website.

Open a new terminal window

Run the following command to launch the client service

```
cd client/src

npm run dev

```

You should see the following: 

```
> client@0.0.0 dev
> vite


  VITE v5.4.10  ready in 2447 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h + enter to show help

```
Copy and paste **http://localhost:5173/** onto your favorite browser.
