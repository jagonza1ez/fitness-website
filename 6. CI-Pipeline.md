# CI/CD Pipeline

## Description

A CI/CD pipeline is a process that automates software development through stages of building, testing, and deploying code. By automating these steps, the objective is to minimize human error and maintain a consistent process for software release.

## Purpose

Currently, the CI pipeline performs the following steps:

1. **Checks Out the Code**
   - Clones the repository to the runner environment, preparing it for the pipeline stages.

2. **Installs Dependencies**
   - Installs all server dependencies listed in `server/package.json`.
   - Installs all client dependencies listed in `client/package.json`.

3. **Runs Placeholder Tests**
   - Executes any defined test scripts in both the server and client directories.
   - Currently, these are placeholders that simply print "No tests defined" and exit with 0 (success) without actually testing any code.

4. **Builds the Client**
   - Uses `vite build` to compile and bundle the client files for production.
   - Generates static assets (like `index.html`, CSS, and JavaScript files) in a `dist` folder.

5. **Sets Up and Starts MongoDB**
   - Sets up and starts a MongoDB service container, allowing the application to connect to MongoDB if necessary during the pipeline.

6. **Cleans Up**
   - Stops and removes the MongoDB container after all tasks are completed.
