## Missing Dependencies
If you are having issues running the program follow this procedure

1. Ensure the server is listening on port 5050.

```
cd server/

node server.js

```
You should see the following message 

" Server listening on port 5050 "

If you get an error, check the **.env** file. You might need to change the **ATLAS_URI** variable to match your MongoDB account.

Next, change directories into the server directory

2. Run the client, to add users into the website. Open a new terminal :

```
cd client/

npm run dev

```

You should see the following, 

```
> client@0.0.0 dev
> vite


  VITE v5.4.10  ready in 144 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h + enter to show help

```

But If you get the following error message, when you run the **npm run dev** command:

```

> client@0.0.0 dev
> vite

sh: 1: vite: not found
```

You  might need to clear existing node_modules and reinstall. 

Run the following commands:

```
rm -rf node_modules

npm install

npx vite -v

npm run dev

```

This will remove the existing node_module, reinstall npm, check for the vite version and run npm again.

You should see the following:

```
> client@0.0.0 dev
> vite


  VITE v5.4.10  ready in 144 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h + enter to show help
```

## Conflicting Ports

Sometimes you get error message when you try to run the server/ directory (node server.js) regarding a port already in-use.

Error message:

```
node:events:495
      throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event
      ^

Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::5050
    at Server.setupListenHandle [as _listen2] (node:net:1811:16)
    at listenInCluster (node:net:1859:12)
    at Server.listen (node:net:1947:7)
    at Function.listen (/home/jagonzalez/dev/websites/fitness-website/server/node_modules/express/lib/application.js:635:24)
    at file:///home/jagonzalez/dev/websites/fitness-website/server/server.js:20:5
    at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:95:5)
Emitted 'error' event on Server instance at:
    at emitErrorNT (node:net:1838:8)
    at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:82:21) {
  code: 'EADDRINUSE',
  errno: -98,
  syscall: 'listen',
  address: '::',
  port: 5050
}

Node.js v18.19.1

```
To fix this do the following: 

list the port in use

```
lsof -i :5050

```
You'll get something like this

```
COMMAND  PID       USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
node    6733 jagonzalez   33u  IPv6  84543      0t0  TCP *:5050 (LISTEN)

```
You are going to have to kill that port using the command **kill** followed by -9 and the PID number listed

```
kill -9 <PID>
```
You can check again if anything is using port 5050

```
lsof -i :5050
```
If nothing shows up, run the server.js file

```
node server.js
```
