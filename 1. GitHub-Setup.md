## Step 1: Install Git

1. Download Git:

   Go to the Git download page and select the version for your OS. 

   https://git-scm.com/downloads

2. Open the Installer:

   - Double-click the downloaded file to start the Git installer.
   If prompted by User Account Control, click Yes to allow the installation.
   Follow the Setup Wizard:

   - Select Destination Location: You can leave the default installation location **(C:\Program Files\Git)** and click Next.
   Select Components: Leave the defaults checked and click Next.
   Choosing the Default Editor:

   - Git needs an editor for writing commit messages. Choose Visual Studio Code, and click Next.
   
3. Adjusting the PATH Environment:

   - Select Use Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software (recommended).
   
   - This option allows you to use Git commands in PowerShell, Command Prompt, and VSCode, making it easier to work with Git from various tools. Click Next.
   
4. Choosing HTTPS Transport Backend:

   - Leave the default option selected (Use the OpenSSL library) and click Next.
   Configuring Line Endings:

   - Choose Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings (recommended) and click Next.
   
5. Configuring Terminal Emulator:

   - Select Use MinTTY (the default terminal for Git Bash), which provides a Linux-like command line. Click Next.
   
6. Additional Configuration Options:

   - Leave the default options selected and click Next until you reach the install button.

   - Click Install to begin the installation. Once finished, keep the box checked for Launch Git Bash and click Finish.

7. **Configure Git**  
   - Open the terminal window on VSCODE (select the + sign and click on **git bash**. 
   - If you haven’t configured Git on your computer, run these commands in the VSCode terminal to set your username and email (have match GITHUB):
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your GitHub Username"
   git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
   ```

8. **Enable GitHub Authentication in VSCode**  
   If you’re using HTTPS, VSCode may prompt you to sign in to GitHub the first time you push changes. Follow the prompts to complete GitHub authentication.

## Step 2: Setting Up GitHub SSH Keys (Optional but Recommended)

SSH keys allow you to connect to GitHub securely without needing to enter your username and password each time. Here’s how to set them up:

1. **Check for Existing SSH Keys**  
   Open your terminal and check if you already have an SSH key:
   ```bash
   ls -al ~/.ssh
   ```
   If you see files like `id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`, you may already have SSH keys set up.

2. **Generate a New SSH Key (if needed)**  
   If no key exists, generate a new SSH key by running:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
   - Replace `"your_email@example.com"` with the email you used for GitHub.
   - Press Enter to accept the default file location, then enter for each prompt.

3. **Add SSH Key to SSH Agent**  
   Start the SSH agent:
   ```bash
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ```
   Add your new key:
   ```bash
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
   ```

4. **Add SSH Key to GitHub**  
   - Copy your SSH key to the clipboard:
     ```bash
     cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
     ```
   - Go to your [GitHub SSH settings](https://github.com/settings/keys) and click **New SSH key**.
   - Paste your SSH key, give it a title (e.g., “My Laptop”), and save.

## Step 3: Clone the Repository Using VSCode

1. **Open VSCode**.
2. **Open the Command Palette** by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac).
3. In the GitHub search for **Code** and select it.
4. **Copy the repository URL**:
   - For SSH:
     ```plaintext
     git@github.com:username/repository-name.git
     ```
   - For HTTPS (if not using SSH):
     ```plaintext
     https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
     ```
5. **Select a local folder** where you want to save the repository, and VSCode will clone it for you.

   - In the terminal window you opened up, type:

     ```bash
     git clone <paste SSH or HTTPS>
     ```

## Step 4: Create and Work on Your Branch

1. **Create a New Branch**  
   In VSCode’s terminal, create a branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch-name
   ```
   Replace `feature-branch-name` with a meaningful name for your feature or bug fix.

2. **Make Your Changes**  
   Edit files in the `client` or `server` directories as needed.

3. **Stage and Commit Changes**  
   - **Stage changes** by clicking the **Source Control** icon (left sidebar) and selecting the files you want to stage, or use:
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
   - **Commit your changes** with a message describing what you did:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Add feature or fix bug"
     ```

## Step 5: Push Changes to GitHub

1. **Push Your Branch**  
   Push your changes to GitHub on your new branch:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-branch-name
   ```
2. **Create a Pull Request**  
   - Go to the repository on GitHub, where you’ll see an option to **Compare & pull request**.
   - Click it, add a title and description, and submit the pull request.

3. **Get Feedback and Merge**  
   After submitting the pull request, team members can review your changes, suggest improvements, and approve the merge when ready.
